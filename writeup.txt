Issues about Franco-English translation:

- Nature of French sentence construction is different than the English one.
	1. Adjectives are placed after the noun, as opposed to English where the qualifying adjectives come before the noun. For example, while in English one would say 'the blue car', in French one would say "la voiture bleue" (translated as 'the car blue').

	2.The issue of Emphasis. In French, the object of emphasis is placed first and then recurrs under the form of a pronoun. It is a very prevalent sentence construction in French, but is not very natural in English. In French you would say "Ce n'est pas moi qui ai acheté la voiture", which would literally be translated as "it is not I who bought the car", which sounds weird. We would just say "I did not buy the car".

	3.Passive sentence constructions are much less common in French than in English. This is due to the existence of the 'on', impersonal construction in French (to signify that some unknown entity 'on' has done the action, like in "on a fermé la porte"), and also thanks to the existence of the expression 'se + verb'. There is some sort of an English equivalent for this, as exemplified in the sentence "apples are selling at two euros a kilo" ( 'les pommes se vendent à deux euros le kilo')

	4. Transitive verbs are used in an intransitive manner sometimes in French. They therefore need to be slightly recast in English. For example, one could say in French "Au risque de scandaliser..." which might be translated as 'At the risk of scandalizing...' but which is actually much more idiomatic as 'at the risk of provoking a scandal'.

	5. Negations are split in two in French. In English, when there isn't a contraction to 'don't', the two words 'do' and 'not' are at least contiguous, which is not the case in French. The expression is 'ne pas' in French, but while the 'ne' is right before the verb it negates, the 'pas' is after the verb, as in "je n'aime pas" ( I do not like) or 'je ne veux pas' (i do not want). In the spoken language, and in everything but formal writing, the 'ne' is dropped. We might therefore say or read "je veux pas" for " I do not want", although this would literally be translated by 'I want not'

	6. French is a verb-framed language, as opposed to English which is a satellite-framed language, as explained in the video lectures. The direction of motion is therefore marked on the verb rathern than on the satellite, unlike in English

	7. Absolute constructions are much more common in French. While the French language uses this construction fairly copiously, it seems very archaic in English.  In French for example, we could say "lui si savant, cette erreur m'etonne". However, in English, saying "he scholarly, this mistake surpises me" (or rather I am surprised by this mistake, which bring us to the next point) would be considered ungrammatical.


- Nominalisation. In French, there are often sentences with clear nominal structures, which do not sound quite as natural in English and which most of the time need to be changed into passive voice or altered to make the verb dominant, since noun-based expressions are much more frequent in French. For example, in French we would say 'sa réaction m'a etonnée'. In English, however, we might not translate this to 'his reaction surprised me' but rather to 'I was surprised by his reaction'. Similarly, we would more likely state that "you performed well" tham 'your performance was good'. What is more, it happens in French that two nouns can be put side to side as in "Le Bourgeois gentilhomme", but where one will take the function of an adjective (here this would translate into something like "the noble bourgeois"), and not the other way around since the noun in this case is the bourgeois and the 'gentilhomme' is the one that is being use as an adjective.

- There is also a number of structural 'false friends' which might cause trouble for recognition by a machine translation
	1. The use of 'si' in a non-conditional context. In some cases, it signals synchronicity, as opposed to a conditional hypothesis, and sometimes also in a concessive sense ('if there are some meat-loving vegeterians, there are also....')
	2. The use of 'que + subjunctive' which is translated by 'the fact that'
	3. The French expression 'ce n'est pas parce que' is literally tranlsated by 'it is not because'. In French it is common to see this as the beginning of a sentence to show that a precedent does not give a justification. However, the English version sounds rather un-idiomatic. It is better to translate it by "The fact that a treaty has been signed does not justify..." or "We cannot afford to sit back just because a treaty has been signed", rather than 'It is not because a treaty has been signed that we can...'
	4. 'Plus que' is the expression for 'more than'. However, on its own, the word 'que' means 'only'. It only gains its comparative sense when combined with the word 'more' or 'less'. Therefore, we would need to be looking at least at bigrams in order to get the right meaning. But in this case, the comparative sense of the word ' que' was low on the list of translations, therefore it was lost and even if we consider bigrams to properly translate, that sense was not included in the dictionary and will therefore not be uncovered. Similarly, 'si' in French can express the conditional 'if', but also the extent 'si bien' is translated to 'so well'. This requires disambiguation. 

- Differences in the use of to be/to have in French, as compared to their English uses. For example, the expression "I have come", for example in the sentence "I have come to see you", would be translated as "Je suis venu te voir", which is "I am come to see you" literally. 

- French also has a lot of pronouns that get 'cut off'. For example, I have is not "Je ai" but 'j'ai', because the language does not allow for two consecutive vowel sounds. 
The placement of these pronouns is also different from in English. Whereas in English, one would say " I found it", it French it would be "Je l'ai trouvé", which could theoretically be expanded to "Je le ai trouvé" ( although this is incorrect, it is just to illustrate the point), which would then be "I it have found".  Interestingly enough, this also shows us that, whereas the English past participle 'have' is implicit in the sentence 'I found it", in French it cannot be excluded. One must say "je l'ai trouvé", as opposed to the nonsensical "Je le trouvé" (I it found). It is therefore not enough to have a rule to switch the pronoun's place here. We need to switch the pronoun, have the past participle, and the contraction of the pronoun because of the fact that the past participle starts with a consonant.
However, if we were translating from French to English, since the past participle is already present, this would have yielded something like " I have found it", which leads to a change of register, to something which may sound more formal than it was meant to be. 


- Demonstrative pronouns are tricky in French. For example, the pronoun 'ce' can refer to 'this' or 'that' and even 'that which', depending on context. 
Other prepositions like 'de' are also tricky and error prone since it could mean 'of' (usually when there is a quantity that follows) or 'by' if there is a subject behind, or even from. It could also mean 'to' in the context of an impersonal sentence structure, like 'it is imperative to', which in French would be 'il est indispensable de...'
Trickiest may be the adverb/preposition 'en' which can be translated by 'in' ( if it's a country), by 'from there', 'here, from it', 'of them', 'of it', 'made of', 'in', 'by', 'while'. It therefore has a multiplicity of meanins, which depend on the context in which it is found. There is furthermore no written distinction between the adverbial and the prepositional forms of the word, unlike in Spanish where there is a diacritic accent to differentiate (for example sí meaning yes, versus si meaning if).


- An obvious but a very major difference is that French places a distinction both on gender and on status or formality, That is to say that all genders must be collpased to a single 'the' (as opposed to 'le' and 'la'), and all addresses are collapsed to 'you' ( as opposed to the 'tu' and 'vous' distinction in French). This may not cause errors per say, but may change the register of the language and alter the effect intended by the author. In some cases, alternate forms may need to be find to be able to preserve these. What is more, while French always has these before nouns, in English, the pronouns are usually implicit ( in French we would say 'ce que veulent les femmes', which is literally translated as 'what the women want', instead of the more idiomatic 'what women want'). 
We therefore need a rule which eliminates the peropositions in the translation, if before an indefinite/indeterminate plural noun. However, it is necessary if it precedes a specified noun. ('On est allé chez le dentiste' is correctly translated as 'we went to the dentist's'). In our text, this is seen with the example of "that women defend themselves so badly", instead of 'that the women defend themselves so badly'
Interestingly enough, the plural form of the pronouns do not mark gender. Therefore the possessive pronoun 'ses' could be translated by 'his' or 'her', depending on the word that follows. The French 'ses' does not make a difference based on the word that follows. We see this in our text with the example of 'ses prières' which could be either 'her prayers' or 'his prayers' (and in this case it is 'her')

- Reflective particules are also very prevalent in the French language, with reflexive verbs. For example, there is a cohort of verbs like 'se regarder, se parler, se trouver...' which use this reflexive 'se', which expresses an interaction with oneself or with another person (these are respectively 'to look at oneself/each other', 'to talk to each other/ to oneself', 'to find oneself somewhere'). The 'se' alone has no real translation, it needs its context to best determine what the action is, and if it is self reflexive or with another person ('I find myself at a crossroad in my life' for example). The French use these reflexive verbs a lot, and some may not readily have a translation. It is common to explain a decision in French by saying to someone 'Je me suis dit que...' which is literally translated as 'I told myself', but which is more accurately translated as 'I figured...'
